lab1

 

The lab is done in group of 2 persons. The lab is not just about implementing features, but mostly about learing how to code with databases which means that the quality of the code is also a factor in grading. Presenting your solutions is done 12/9 and you allocate a time slot through Canvas.

 

If something is unclear about the lab, ASK the teacher!




In this lab we use the the model you worked on in assignment 1, this means you have to combine your solutions in your group, The goal is to make a program, with UI, using the database according to the requirements.

 

In the lab you need to setup a SQL database (recommended is postgres or mysql) and create your database in it.

 

After that you need to write a program that access the database (recommended is Java or Python, if you want to use anything else you have to talk to the teacher). The program should create a UI for accessing and using the database.  For lower degree its fine with a text interface.



For higher degree the system should support free text doctor notes which can included files or images, The UI must be graphical.
